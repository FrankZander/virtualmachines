"Hello _FullName_,

The attached RDP files can be used to connect to your FME Virtual Machine.

Please wait 10 minutes after receiving this email before trying to connect the the virtual machine; they take approximately 10 minutes to boot.

Please try _PublicIpAddress_.rdp first. 
Double-click on _PublicIpAddress_.rdp to open it in Microsoft Remote Desktop.

The username is administrator
The password is FMElearnings#1

Some organizations block the port used by RDP; port 3389.

If _PublicIpAddress_.rdp does not work, please try the other two RDP files; _PublicIpAddress_Port8080.rdp and _PublicIpAddress_Port443.rdp.
These RDP files use different ports that might not be blocked.

If none of the RDP files will connect, then your Security Administrator is likely using a Web Security Gateway. 
This cannot be bypassed without contacting your IT Department. 
Please contact your IT Department, and tell them you need to use Remote Desktop to connect to _PublicIpAddress_ 

As a last-resort, you can try to use an HTML5 Remote Desktop Client.
Go to http://54.205.104.160/myrtille
Server: _PublicIpAddress_
User: administrator
